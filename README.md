# Code-for-Thesis-GNN-for-feature-based-clustering-of-German-s-energy-grid
This repository provides the code for my thesis.
The notebooks are most important.
In "preliminary_work" there is some initial trying out work and investigation of the dataset and some plotting.
In "clustering_implementation" the clustering is done and the steps are explained.
In "optimized_networks_results" the network after running the experiments on the cluster are loaded and analyzed and plots for my thesis are created.
The folder "cluster and optimisation scripts for running experiments on galvani" are the scripts for clustering and optimising on the galvani cluster and mainly repetative.
